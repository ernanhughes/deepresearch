      "1. INTRODUCTION  I do not know where to start, so I will just state the obvious hopping that this will let us realize some of the obviousness that we miss. The emergence of simple patterns out of complex systems motivates the study of behavior independent of the particulars of a system. Cellular Automata is a simple tool that displays such characteristics and is therefore useful for modeling.  Cellular automata are particularly useful for presenting parallel computation, and can be thought of as its basic building blocks. Cellular automata sometimes display complex behavior even when simple rules are applied.  It is natural then, to extend the models of cellular automata to encompass what we believe about nature and computation.  In this report we attempt to provide a useful introduction to quantum cellular automata from a computing perspective. For clarity and accessibility we provide a brief overview of both quantum computing and classical cellular automata.  \n",

      "2. BRIEF OVERVIEW OF QUANTUM MECHANICS  2.1 THE BEAM SPLITTER EXPERIMENT As a start, we will present two brief experiments to illustrate some basic concepts in quantum mechanics. The outcome of the last experiment seems counterintuitive because everyday phenomena are well within good classical physics approximation range. In figure 1, a light source emits a photon along a path towards a half-silvered mirror. This mirror splits the light, reflecting half vertically towards detector A and transmitting half toward detector B. Our intuition would tell us that the photon leaves the mirror either towards A or B with equal probability since it cannot be split. The fact that a photon cannot split have been verified through detecting a signal at only one detector. This means that photons will be detected 50% of the time at each of the two detectors. So far, the quantum physical prediction agrees with the classical one. \n",
      " \n",
      "Figure 1: Experiment 1 using one beam splitter  This peace of information is misleading since it might lead us to think that the photon leaves either towards A or towards B. However, quantum \n",
      "7 \n",
      "mechanics predicts, through the effect known as single-particle interference, that the photon actually travels along both paths simultaneously, collapsing down to one path only upon measurement. The following experiment illustrates the last effect. \n",
      " \n",
      "Figure 2: Experiment 2 using two beam splitters  In this experiment, we introduce a fully silvered mirror instead of each detector of the first experiment such that the two paths will encounter a half-silvered mirror before reaching detectors A and B. Once a photon will reach the last half-silvered mirror, along either one of the two paths, one might think that the photon will reach the detectors A or B with a probability of 50% each. However in this experiment, the detector A or the detector B will register a hit 100% of the time whereas the other one will never be triggered.  In this experiment, our classical intuition based on the conditional probability doesnt predict such outcome. We cannot explain this conclusion based on a comparison with the first experiment. This phenomenon is known as single-particle interference. One interpretation quantum physics states that the photon traveled both paths simultaneously; creating interference at the point of \n",
      "8 \n",
      "intersection that canceled the possibility of the photon to reach the other detector. Consequently, if we cancel out the effect of quantum interference by placing an absorbing screen on one of the paths, both detectors will registers 50% hits similar to the first experiment. Those potential paths taken by the photon represent the superposition of the possible photon states.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Figure 3: Placing an obstacle on one of the paths  Those special characteristics as the superposition of different states and interference give the quantum computer the potential to be incredible powerful computational devices. Therefore, quantum computers are not seen as continuity of classical computers but as an entirely new branch of thoughts.  2.2 QUANTUM MECHANICS POSTULATES  In this section we introduce the four postulates of quantum mechanics as they are relevant to our investigation in quantum information processing. Quantum postulates are very important in a sense that they provide the connections between the physical, real, world and the quantum mechanics mathematics used to model these systems. \n",

However, if the qubits are allowed to interact, then the closed system includes all the qubits together, and it may not be possible to write the state in the product form. When this is the case, we say that the qubits in the ensemble are entangled (refer to later sections for further analysis of entanglement).   2.3 QUANTUM BITS 2.3.1Qubits The fundamental resource and basic unit of quantum information is the quantum bit (qubit). From a physical point of view, a qubit is represented by an ideal two-state quantum system. Examples of such systems include photons (vertical and horizontal polarization), electrons and other spin-1/2 systems (spin up and down), and systems defined by two energy levels of atoms or ions. From the beginning the two-state system played a central role in studies of quantum mechanics. It is the most simple quantum system, and in principle all other quantum systems can be modeled in the state space of collections of qubits. \n",
      "11 \n",
      "A qubit is represented as unit vector in a two dimensional complex vector space for which a particular orthonormal basis, denoted by{0,1}, has been fixed. The notation for these states was introduced by Dirac. It is called the ket notation, and its variations are widely used in quantum physics. It is important to notice that the basis vector 0is not the zero vector of the vector space.  For the purposes of quantum computing, the basis states 0 and 1 encode the classical bit values 0 and 1 respectively. Unlike classical bits however, qubits can be in a superposition of 0and 1such as 01where  and  are complex numbers such that221. If such a superposition is measured with respect to the basis{0,1}, the probability that the measured value is 0is 2and the probability that the measured value is 1is 2.  Key properties of quantum bits:  1. A qubit can be in a superposition state of 0 and 1.  2. Measurement of a qubit in a superposition state will yield probabilistic results.  3. Measurement of a qubit changes the state to the result.   2.3.2 Tensor products  Much computational power of quantum systems comes from the fact that as the number of qubits increases linearly, the amount of information stored \n",
      "12 \n",

A classical (macroscopic) physical object broken into pieces can be described and measured as separate components. An n-particle quantum system cannot always be described in terms of the states of its component pieces. For instance, the state 0011cannot be decomposed into separate states of each of the two qubits in the form1122(0,1)(01)abab.  This is because 112212121212(0,1)(01)000110,11ababaaabbabb \n",
      "and a1b2 = 0 implies that either a1a2 = 0 or b1b2 = 0. States which cannot be decomposed in this way are called entangled states. These are states that don't have classical counterparts, and for which our intuition is likely to fail.  When particles are entangled, a measurement of one affects a measurement of the other. For example, the state 1(0011)2is entangled since the probability of measuring the first bit as 0is 1/2 if the second bit has not been measured. However, if the second bit has been measured, the probability that the first bit is measured as 0is either 1 or 0, depending on whether the second bit was measured as 0or 1, respectively. On the other hand, the state \n",
      "14 \n",
      "1(0001)2is not entangled. Since11(0001)0(01)22, any measurement of the first bit will yield 0regardless of measurements of the second bit. Similarly, the second bit has a fifty-fifty chance of being measured as 0regardless of measurements of the first bit. Therefore, entanglement is a non-classical correlation between two quantum systems. It is most strongly exhibited by the maximally entangled states such as the Bell states for two qubits, and is considered to be absent in mixtures of product states (separable states). Often states that are not separable are considered to be entangled. However, nearly separable states do not exhibit all the features of maximally entangled states. As a result, studies of different types of entanglement are an important component of quantum information theory.  2.4 QUANTUM COMPUTING  This exponential growth in number of states, together with the ability to subject the entire space to transformations (either unitary dynamical evolution of the system, or a measurement projection into an eigenvector subspace), provides the foundation for quantum computing.  An interesting (apparent) dilemma is the energetic costs/irreversibility of classical computing. Since unitary transformations are invertible, quantum computations (except measurements) will all be reversible by restricting them to unitary quantum transformations. This means that every quantum gate (on one or many qubits) implements a reversible computation. That is, given the output of the gate, it must be possible to unambiguously determine what the \n",
      "15 \n",
      "input was. Fortunately, there is a classical theory of reversible computation that tells us that every classical algorithm can be made reversible with an acceptable overhead, so this restriction on quantum computation does not pose a serious problem. It is something that must be kept in mind when proposing a specification for a quantum gate, however.  We will illustrate quantum gate representation through an example of the quantum version of the classical not gate. It is represented byxand has the effect of negating the values of the computational basis. That is, using ket notation, (01)1001not \n",

Because of linearity, the transformations are fully specified by their effect on the basis vectors. The associated matrix is also shown. They are known as the four the four Pauli gates. \n",

By analogy to classical computation, one may ask what kind of quantum gates we need in order implement an arbitrary unitary transformation. Since the number of possible unitary transformation is uncountable, one can not find a set of basic gates that construct exactly every unitary transformation. However, there exist universal gates which can construct any transformation U within bounded error . Said in other words, we can construct a circuit U from those gates that simulates U within the allowed . A universal set of operations is: H, X, T, and CNot. \n",

Furthermore, more recently, Lov Grover came up with a quantum search algorithm that has a run time complexity proportional to nwithout any knowledge about the function f.

      "3. CLASSICAL CELLULAR AUTOMATA  3. 1 WHY CELLULAR AUTOMATA? In the late 1940s, Von Neumann set to answer the question of whether a machine can possibly fabricate machines as complicated as themselves. In an attempt to simplify the problem, he considered that machines or automatons are made up of a small number of standardized parts.  In his model, a complex reservoir full of floating machine parts is used. Von Neumann was able proof, using mathematical logic, that a system made of an automaton and a blueprint for building the automaton can self-replicate by: First making a copy of the blueprint and then use the blueprints instructions for making a copy of the automaton. It is interesting to observe that the blueprint is analogous to DNA for self-reproduction.  Von Neumann needed a simpler model to formulate a more convincing and constructive proof. S. Ulam, his colleague at Los Alamos, suggested thinking in terms of an idealized space of cells that hold finite states, where each state represent different machine part.  The idea was clearly presented in a paper by Ulam:  Given is an infinite lattice or graph of points, each with a finite number of connections to certain of its \"neighbors\". Each point is capable of a finite number of \"states\". The states of neighbors at time tn induce, in a specified manner, the state of the point at time tn+1 \n",

In all other cases, a cell dies or remains dead (overcrowding or loneliness).  The games simple rules generate beautiful patterns that to a certain extent seem alive. Conway later proved that the Game of Life is computationally universal.  In the late 70s, Fredkin proposed that the world we live in is a huge cellular automaton. Fredkins thought that all physical quantities can be seen as packets of information that reside in a cellular automaton.   S. Wolfram entered the field of cellular automata in the early 1980s. After a series of discoveries about one dimensional cellular automata, Wolfram decided to retire from publishing and indulge in a private investigation of cellular automata. In 2002, and after 15 years, Wolfram publishes his work in a book entitled A New Kind of Science (NKS). The book has been very controversial.  It remains to point the interesting fact that many of the leading researchers in Quantum Computing where also leading researchers in Cellular Automata, notable Charles Bennett, Tommaso Toffoli, and Norman Margolus. Applications of Cellular automata range from parallel computation, artificial life, image processing and image generation, modeling biological systems,  simulations of chemistry, simulation of  physics, turbulence, algorithm and hardware design, graphics, and art. \n",

      "3. 2 DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATIONS A Cellular Automaton (CA) is a regular discrete infinite network of identical finite automaton called cells, the state of which changes on discrete time steps. The evolution of each cell is deterministic and depends upon a local finite number of so-called neighboring cells.  More formally, a Cellular Automata is a quadruple,,,dQN, where *dZ is its dimension, Q is the finite set of all possible states, dNZ is a finite neighborhood, : Q|N| Q is a local transition function.  The cells of the automaton are organized in a line and are indexed by the elements of Z. The neighborhood of a cell is the set of all cells in the network which will locally determine its evolution. Von Neumanns and Moores neighborhoods are two examples of commonly studied neighborhoods in d = 2. In general the neighborhood of a cell do not have to be near, however it has been shown that every d-dimensional neighborhood can be simulated by a d-dimensional nearest neighborhood. The radius of a neighborhood is the distance between the cell and its furthest neighbor. A related problem would be to optimize the radius versus the number of states. It is interesting to note that for a realistic model of computation we do not consider CAs whose ratio between the radius and the number of states is exponential since in such a setting NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time. The following is a simple example of 1 dimensional, 2 state with radius=1, rule: \n",

      "  Bellow is a sketch of that simulates the evolution of the rule starting with an initial condition of {00100}:          \n",
      "Wolfram devised an efficient representation of the local transition function (sometimes called rule). We describe the representation for the one-dimensional case: There is 23=8 different combination of states that determine the next state of a given cell, for every combination the rule can produce either a 0 or 1, so we have 28=256 possible rules. Thus one can specify a rule by associating it with an 8-bit number determined by setting the ith bit to 0 if the corresponding combination outputs a 0 and 1 otherwise. For example the rule shown above is rule number 01111110=126. In the early 1980s wolfram discovered that simple cellular automata rules can yield complex behavior, and he classifies cellular automata into four main categories: \n",
      "\n",
      "25 \n",
      "Class 1 is characterized by simple behavior and that information about initial conditions is always rapidly forgotten. Rule 254 is an example of this class; the following shows its evolutions starting with 6 different random initial conditions.          \n",
      "Class 2 is also simple but it has many fixed or periodic orbits, and from most initial states it will quickly converge to one of those orbits. In a Class 2 some information in the initial state is retained in the final configurationbut this information always remains completely localized. Rule 170 is a common example:        \n",
      "Class 3 behavior is characterized by apparent randomness it shows long-range communication of information so that any change made anywhere \n",

      "in the system will almost always eventually be communicated even to the most distant parts of the system. It is somewhat surprising that there are simple cellular automata that belong to this class, Rule 30 is an example:       Class 4 is in-between Classes 2 and 3, it is characterized by regions with apparently random mixing and regions with localized structures that stay stationary or move linearly. A collision between two moving structures is an interaction that can be viewed as a two-bit a gate.  The Game of Life belongs to this class. Wolfram discovered that Rule 110 also belongs to this class and proved that it is computationally universal. Wolfram also conjunctures that all Class 4 cellular automata simulate the Turing Machine. In fact, Wolfram claims the principle of computational equivalence which states that almost all processes that are not obviously simple can be viewed as computations of equivalent sophistication. The following shows Rule 110:      \n",

Hedlund and Richardson proved that a cellular automaton is reversible if and only if it is bijective.  Non-trivial reversible cellular automata are rare. In fact, for2d, it is undecidable whether a d-dimensional cellular automaton is reversible (Kari 1990). However, Toffoli (1977) proved that any k-dimensional CA can be simulated in real time by a (k+1)-dimensional reversible CA. Moreover, Dubacq (1985) proved that there is a universal cellular automaton that is reversible.   \n",

      "4. QUANTUM CELLULAR AUTOMATA   4. 1 WHY QUANTUM CELLULAR AUTOMATA:  The very first attempts to create quantum versions of the classical models of computation have been oriented towards cellular automata. From an experimental point of view, QCA have a significant advantage over quantum circuits because cells are not required to be able to distinguish one neighbor from another. In cellular automata uniform rules are applied in parallel across a lattice, therefore it is not needed to address each qubit separately. This helps to eliminate error resulting from cross talk on neighboring qubits due to imperfectly aligned control fields. In addition, many fabrication techniques naturally produce equally spaced units suitable for cellular automata computation. Physical systems proposed for QCA include quantum dot arrays and endohedral fullerenes. The first example of a QCA was Feynman's \"quantum checkerboard\" model of spinors in 2d spacetime, dating back at least to 1965. The history of attempts to introduce the concept of quantum cellular automata goes back to Grossing and Zeilinger (1988) and a series of subsequent papers by the authors, however there model has little in common with the models currently in use.  In 1990, Norm Marglous wrote Parallel Quantum Computation, later Biafore considered the problem of synchronization. The first successful model of one dimensional quantum cellular automata was due to Watrous (1995). To some, studying QCA is theoretically motivated by the view that information is the fundamental element of nature and computing is the \n",
      "31 \n",
      "fundamental process. The universe is then perceived as giant quantum cellular automaton.   4. 2 DEFINITION AND RESTRICTIONS:   Watrouss model deals with quiescent QCA that have finite configurations:  A 1d-QCA is a quadruple,,,QN, Q is the finite set of all possible states including the quiescent state, 1{,....,}rNnn is a finite neighborhood, and : Qr+1 \n",
      "[0,1]C is a local transition function. Where [0,1]C is an interval in the field of complex number of norm in [0,1]. To see how the transition function works consider an example:  If we are working with a symmetric quantum cellular automata with a neighborhood of size 3 then if three consecutive cells are in the states q1, q2, and q3 at time t, then at time t+1 the middle cell will contain every q Qwith amplitude123(,,,)qqqq.  Again the concept of a configuration:tcZQis used to define how a 1d-QCA evolves. Since we are working with finite configurations, a valid configuration is such that ()cifor only finitely manyi.  If we let C denote the set of all such configurations, then computation is done in the inner product space 2()HlCwith bases{|}ccC.

      "preserves the 2l- norm (equivalently E has to be injective). Durr, LeThanh and Santha devised an algorithm to check this property in 2()Ontime.   Well-formedness is equivalent to the orthonormality of the column vectors of the time evolution operator; unitarity also requires orthonormality from the row vectors (E has to be Bijective). Durr and Santha published an algorithm that checks in 311()rrOntime if a 1d-QCA is unitary, where r is the size of the neighborhood.  \n",

This result directly follows from Karis theorem for reversible CA. In the literature, quiescent QCA is the most common, periodic QCA where considered by Van Dam in his masters thesis. Van Dam showed that for periodic QCA there exists a universal quantum cellular automaton (in the sense that it can simulate any other cellular automaton in polynomial steps). This result does not apply, however, to the more general quiescent QCA.  In fact Durr has proved that periodic QCA are a subset of quiescent QCAs.  4. 3 SUBCLASSES OF QCA Partitioned Cellular Automata (PCA) is a special case of CA introduced by Morita and Harao in 1989. Watrous introduced the quantum version since it is easy to determine whether a PQCA is unitary or not.  A one dimensional Partitioned Quantum Cellular Automata is a 1d-QCA in which each cell is into three sub-cells: left, middle, and right. The next state of a cell depends on the state of: the right sub-cell of the left neighbor, the middle sub-cell of itself, and the left sub-cell of the right neighbor.      \n",

Notice that this is different from other cellular automata in which the mapping is into individual cells not groups of cells.

Benjamin speculated on several systems in the solid state where qubits are represented by the spins of individual electrons, whose wave functions (light gray) are trapped in confinement potentials (dark gray): (a) Confining potentials are shaped so that there is only significant wave function overlap when there is an applied field (left).

ADVANCED ISSUES  Recent results in Quantum Cellular Automata: Benjamin and Johnson presented the architecture constitutes a novel paradigm whereby the algorithm is embedded in spatial, as opposed to temporal, structure. The architecture was used to search in time of O(1/3N) . Gavin K. Brennen and Jamie E. Williams generalized BQCA to open quantum systems, which evolve according to non-unitary rules. The BQCA rule is then represented by an appropriate set of Krauss operators acting on the system density matrix. This more generalized treatment can be thought of as including the effect of correlated noise in the quantum evolution. Michael McGuigan generalized the definition of quantum cellular automata to include bosonic, fermionic, and supersymmetric and spin quantum system, by applying methods of lattice field theories to the quantization of the bosonoic and fermionic models using the path integral formulation.    \n",

      "contexts: the pentagrid, the heptagrid and the dodecagrid, these tilings\n",

      "Key words : cellular automata, weak universality, hyperbolic spaces, tilings.\n",
      "1 Introduction\n",
      "In this paper, we look at the possibility to embed one-dimensional cellular au-\n",
      "tomata, 1 D- for short, into hyperbolic cellular automata in the pentagrid, the\n",
      "heptagrid or the dodecagrid which are denoted by {5, 4}, {7, 3} and {5, 3, 4}\n",
      "respectively. We consider 1 D-cellular automata which are deterministic and\n",
      "whose number of cells is inﬁnite.\n",
      "First, we shall prove a general theorem, and then we shall try to s trengthen\n",
      "it at the price of a restriction on the set of cellular automata which we wish to\n",
      "embed in the case of the pentagrid.\n",
      "The ﬁrst theorem says:\n",
      "Theorem 1 There is a uniform algorithm to transform a deterministic 1D-\n",
      "cellular automaton with n states into a deterministic cellular automaton in the\n",
      "pentagrid, the heptagrid or the dodecagrid with, in each cas e, n+1 states. More-\n",
      "over, the cellular automaton obtained by the algorithm is ro tation invariant.\n",
      "Later on, as we consider deterministic cellular automata only, we dro p this\n",
      "precision. This theorem has a lot of corollaries, in particular we get th is one,\n",
      "about weak universality:\n",
      "Corollary 1There is a weakly universal cellular automaton in the pentag rid,\n",
      "in the heptagrid and in the dodecagrid which is weakly univer sal and which has\n",
      "three states exactly, one state being the quiescent state. M oreover, the cellular\n",
      "automaton is rotation invariant.\n",
      "We prove Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 in Section 2. In particular, we rem ind\n",
      "the notion of rotation invariance, especially for the 3 D case. In Section 3, we\n",
      "1\n",
      "strengthen the results, but this needs a restriction on the cellular automata\n",
      "under consideration in the case of the pentagrid.\n",
      "2 Proof of Theorem 1 and its corollary\n",
      "The idea of theorem 1 is very simple. Consider a one-dimensional cellular au-\n",
      "tomaton A. The support of the cells of A is transported into a structure of the\n",
      "hyperbolic grid which we consider as a line of tiles. In each one of the three\n",
      "tilings which we shall consider, we deﬁne the line of tiles in a speciﬁc way. We\n",
      "examine these case, one after the other.\n",
      "2.1 In the pentagrid\n",
      "In the case of the pentagrid, it is the set of cells such that one side of the cells is\n",
      "supported by the same line of the hyperbolic plane which we assume to be a line\n",
      "of the tiling, call it the guideline of the implementation. It is a line supported\n",
      "by a side of a cell ﬁxed once for all, see Figure 1. In this ﬁgure, the line is\n",
      "represented by the yellow cells along the guideline. Note that a yellow c ell has\n",
      "exactly two yellow neighbours. The cells are generated by the shift a long the\n",
      "guideline which transforms one of the neighbours of the cell into the cell itself.\n",
      "Figure 1 Implementation of a cellular automaton in the pentagrid. Th e yellow cells\n",
      "represent the line of tiles used for the 1D-CA. The blue cells represent the cells which\n",
      "receive the new state.\n",
      "2\n",
      "In the ﬁgure, the yellow colour is assumed to represent the n states of the\n",
      "original automaton. The blue cells represent the additional state w hich is dif-\n",
      "ferent from the n original ones.\n",
      "In the ﬁgure, there are three hues of blue which allow us to represe nt the\n",
      "tree structure of the tiling. These diﬀerent hues represent the s ame state.\n",
      "From the ﬁgure, it is plain that we have the following situation: yellow ce lls\n",
      "have exactly two yellow cells among their neighbours, the cell itself no t being\n",
      "taken into account. A blue cell has at most one yellow cell in its neighbo urhood.\n",
      "Accordingly, this diﬀerence is enough to deﬁne the implementation of the rules\n",
      "in the pentagrid.\n",
      "Denote the format of a rule by η0η1...η 5η1\n",
      "0 where η0 is the current state of\n",
      "the cell, ηi is the current state of neighbour i of the cell and η1\n",
      "0 is the new state\n",
      "of the cell, obtained after the rule was applied. We assume that the r ules are\n",
      "rotation invariant . This means that if π is a circular permutation on {1.. 5}\n",
      "and if η0η1...η 5η1\n",
      "0 is a rule of the automaton, η0ηπ (1)...η π (5)η1\n",
      "0 is also a rule of the\n",
      "automaton. As we assume the rules to be invariant, the numbering h as only to\n",
      "be ﬁxed according to the orientation: we consider that it increases from 1 to 5\n",
      "as we clockwise turn around the tile. Which side is number 1 is not import ant.\n",
      "However, for the convenience of the reader, we ﬁx it as follows.\n",
      "We may assume that the central cell has coordinate 0. We number it s sides\n",
      "from 1 to 5, 1 being the number of the sides which is shared by a yellow c ell on\n",
      "the left-hand side of the ﬁgure, the other sides being increasingly n umbered while\n",
      "clockwise turning around the tile. The left-hand part of the yellow line is the\n",
      "right-most branch of the tree which spans the corresponding qua rter attached\n",
      "to the central cell, see [3, 4] for explanations. In this cells, number 1 is given\n",
      "to the side shared with the father and the others are also deﬁned a s for the\n",
      "central cells. In particular, all the cells have their side 2 supported by the line\n",
      "deﬁning the yellow cells. On the right-hand side of the central cell, we have a\n",
      "branch deﬁned by the middle son of the white nodes, starting from t he root of\n",
      "the corresponding tree. We take the same convention for the num bering of the\n",
      "sides, number 1 being given to the side shared with the father. Then , we notice\n",
      "that all the cells of this part of the yellow line have their side 5 on the line .\n",
      "Now, the rules for a blue cell are: bη1..η 5b, all ηi’s being b except possibly\n",
      "one of them. The rules for a yellow cell are: η0η1bbη4bη1\n",
      "0 , where η1η0η4 → η1\n",
      "0\n",
      "is the unique rule of A which can be associated to the cell.\n",
      "2.2 In the heptagrid\n",
      "Figure 2 illustrates the implementation in the case of the heptagrid.\n",
      "This time, the guideline is not a line of the tiling as the lines which support a\n",
      "side cut each second tile they meet. However, it is possible to deﬁne a guideline\n",
      "by taking the mid-point lines: it was proved in [3] that the mid-points of two\n",
      "contiguous sides of a heptagon deﬁne a line which cuts the other tiles at the\n",
      "mid-points of two contiguous sides. It is not diﬃcult to see that exac tly two\n",
      "neighbours of a cell crossed by the guideline are also crossed by this line, in\n",
      "the same way, through the mid-points of two consecutive sides and are in the\n",
      "3\n",
      "same half-plane deﬁned by the guideline. By taking the shift along the guideline\n",
      "which transforms one of these neighbours into the cell itself we can generate all\n",
      "the cells which belong to the expected line.\n",
      "In the setting of the heptagrid, the format of a rule is deﬁned in ter ms which\n",
      "are very similar to those used for the pentagrid. The main diﬀerence is that here,\n",
      "the interval [1 .. 5] is replaced by [1 .. 7]. The numbering of the sides is deﬁned in\n",
      "the same way as in the pentagrid. Indeed, as known from [3], the pe ntagrid and\n",
      "the heptagrid are spanned by the same tree. Again, ﬁxing number 1 to the side\n",
      "shared with the father and a side, ﬁxed once for all, in the case of th e central\n",
      "cell, the cells which are above the central cell have their sides 2 and 3 meeting\n",
      "the guideline and the cells which are below have theirs side 6 and 7 meetin g the\n",
      "guideline.\n",
      "Figure 2 Implementation of a cellular automaton in the heptagrid. Th e yellow cells\n",
      "represent the line of tiles used for the 1D-CA. The blue cells represent the cells which\n",
      "receive the new state.\n",
      "Also, this time, the format of the rule is η0η1...η 7η1\n",
      "0. Now, looking at Fig-\n",
      "ure 2, we can see that the rules for the blue cells are of the form bη1...η 7b\n",
      "where, among η1...η 7 two states exactly are b. Moreover, these states are in\n",
      "consecutive neighbours of the cell, taking into account the circular structure of\n",
      "the neighbouring. This means that there is a circular permutation of the num-\n",
      "bers such that η1 = η2 = b. Now, for a yellow cell, the format of the rules is\n",
      "η0η1bbbη5bbη1\n",
      "0 for the central cell together with the cells which are below, and\n",
      "η0η1bbη4bbbη1\n",
      "0 for the cells above the central cell. The central cell and those\n",
      "which are below apply the rule η1η0η5 → η1\n",
      "0 of the automaton. The cells which\n",
      "4\n",
      "are above the central cell apply the rule η4η0η1 → η1\n",
      "0 of the automaton.\n",
      "Accordingly, we proved Theorem 1 for what are the grid of the hype rbolic\n",
      "plane which we considered. It can easily be proved that the same res ult holds\n",
      "for all the grids of the hyperbolic plane of the form {p, 4} and {p+2, 3}, with\n",
      "p ≥ 5.\n",
      "2.3 In the dodecagrid\n",
      "In the dodecagrid, we use the representation introduced in [7]. We brieﬂy remind\n",
      "it here for the convenience of the reader.\n",
      "In fact, we consider the projection of the dodecahedra on a plane which is\n",
      "deﬁned by a ﬁxed face of one of them: this will be the plane of refere nce Π 0. The\n",
      "trace of the tiling on Π 0 is a copy of the pentagrid. So that, using a projection\n",
      "of each dodecahedron which is in contact with Π 0 and on the same half-space\n",
      "it deﬁnes which we call the half-space above Π 0, we obtain a representation of\n",
      "the line which is given by Figure 3. Indeed, the projection of each dod ecahedron\n",
      "on this face looks like a Schlegel diagram, see [7, 3] for more details on this tool\n",
      "dating from the 19 th century.\n",

      "represent the line of tiles used for the one-dimensional CA. The blue cells represent\n",
      "the cells which receive the new state.\n",
      "Accordingly, the guideline is simply a line of the pentagrid which lies on Π 0.\n",
      "On the ﬁgure, we can see that the line which implements the one-dimen sional\n",
      "cellular automaton is represented by the yellow cells, the other cells w hich receive\n",
      "5\n",

      "0. Now, as the\n",
      "rules are assumed to be rotation invariant, which face receives num ber 1 is\n",
      "not important. However, for the convenience of the reader, we s hall adopt the\n",

      "appear in Figure 4. Moreover, we consider that the other face of t he cell which\n",

      "Consider a motion which preserves the orientation, we shall say a positive\n",

      "in the following format:\n",

      "and η1\n",
      "0 the new state of the cell. Remember that this numbering of the neigh -\n",
      "bours is given to the cells in increasing numbers while counter-clockwis e turning\n",
      "around the cell, 1 being the number of the northern neighbour. Acc ordingly,\n",
      "the correspondence can be given by the following diagram:\n",
      "η1 η2 η3 η4\n",
      "north west south east\n",
      "5.1 General conditions\n",
      "In order to deﬁne the rules, we start from the conﬁgurations indicated in Sec-\n",
      "tion 4. Our ﬁrst observation is that we have two kinds of rules: the conserva-\n",
      "tive ones and the active ones. A conservative rule is a rule in which the new\n",
      "state of the cell is the same as the current one. An active rule is the opposite:\n",
      "the new state is diﬀerent from the current one. This remark is impor tant: the\n",
      "active rules are derived from the propagation of the various signals described\n",
      "in the scenario and the conservative ones are needed for keeping a part of the\n",
      "conﬁguration unchanged as long as it is needed.\n",
      "Another point which we have to take into account is that the scenar io in-\n",
      "volves situations which induces a lot of rules due to the discrete natu re of the\n",
      "cellular automaton. It is not possible to describe here all the rules ind uced by\n",
      "these particular cases. In fact, the particular cases can be desc ribed by a few\n",
      "parameters. We have four parameters which determine the initial c onﬁguration:\n",
      "a,b, r and µ. What we shall call the general case and for which we shall see\n",
      "the rules in this section, are the initial conﬁgurations in which a, b, r, µ, as\n",
      "well as |a−b|, |a−r|, |a−|µ||, |b−r|, |b−|µ|| and |r−|µ|| are large. In practice,\n",
      "this means that the particular cases are deﬁned by the conﬁgurat ions when at\n",
      "least one of these parameters are less than 4. When the other par ameters are\n",
      "29\n",
      "at least 4, the rules are the same for all cases deﬁned by a ﬁxed valu e of the\n",
      "considered parameter. As will be clear from the ﬁgures of Section 4 , the rules\n",
      "needed for the particular cases introduce shortcuts leading from one phase of\n",
      "the cycle to the next one. An example is given by the ﬁgures of Sectio n 4 where,\n",
      "for instance, |µ| = 2, a particular case. As an example, the situation concerning\n",
      "the BV - or BU -areas at the beginning of the area and the situation concerning\n",
      "the end of the area address consecutive steps in the computation : any rule re-\n",
      "garding a cell of the area implies a neighbouring cell which does not belo ng to\n",
      "the area. And so, there are speciﬁc rules accordingly.\n",
      "Now, during the construction of the rules, as our automaton is det erministic,\n",
      "we have to always check the following condition: if two rules η0η1η2η3η4η1\n",
      "0 and\n",

      "0 = ω 1\n",
      "0. If this condition\n",
      "is satisﬁed for all pairs of rules, we say that the rules are compatible. If the\n",

      "incompatible or that ρi is in contradiction with ρj , where {i, j } = {1, 2}.\n",

      "merical value for the expressiveness of a rule. Here we found that this is possible for\n",
      "most of the rules, but not for all of them: for rules that develop Sierpi` nski patterns,\n",
      "the expressiveness of their conﬁgurations varies greatly over time. Nevertheless, its\n",
      "values belong for rules of diﬀerent phenomenological types to diﬀerent intervals, so\n",
      "that it is still possible to distinguish the types of the rules by the expressiveness of\n",
      "a sample conﬁguration at a certain time.\n",
      "So we can characterize the behavior of a cellular automaton by the expressive-\n",
      "ness of its conﬁgurations. If this automaton simulates a biological system, has this\n",
      "expressiveness then a meaningful interpretation? To answer this question, we inves-\n",
      "tigated whether there is a species-area relation for cellular automata, as there is for\n",
      "many biological systems. Cellular automata with such a relation resemble biological\n",
      "systems most closely. We found that there is only one transition rule that has a\n",

      "This paper describes several ECA classiﬁcations. Consequently, we can compare\n",
      "quickly some basic properties and use these relations for future classiﬁcations.\n",
      "In this respect, a remarkable and important result was published by Culik II\n",
      "and Yu in 1988, who proved that such classiﬁcations are undecidable [9]. How-\n",

      "We know from previous studies that ECA composed with memory (ECAM)\n",

      "In particular, previous analysis has shown that chaotic ECA rules composed\n",
      "with memory are capable of displaying complex behaviour (for ECA rule 30 see\n",

      "composition produces a new rule, but with elements of the original ECA rule.\n",
      "This way, memory functions help to ‘discover’ hidden information in dynamical\n",
      "systems from simple functions (or rules), and “transform” simple and chaotic\n",

      "updates of a cell is equal to:α(1 −α)k−1.)\n",
      "There are of course many other types of updating schemes where randomness\n",
      "is involved. For instance, one may consider random sweeps where cells are\n",
      "updated sequentially by following random permutations of the updating orders\n",

      "order is drawn at the beginning and kept ﬁxed during the whole evolution of\n",

      "which results from an imperfect transmission of the state from the neighbours\n",
      "(see Sec. 3.4).\n",
      "Non-random updating schemes can also be considered: for instance, in the\n",

      "Probabilistic Cellular Automata are extended stochastic systems, widely used for modelling\n",
      "phenomena in many disciplines. The possibility of controlling their behaviour is therefore an\n",
      "important topic. We shall present here an approach to the problem of controlling such systems by\n",
      "acting only on the boundary of a target region.\n",
      "1 Introduction\n",
      "Cellular Automata (CA) are widely used for studying the mathematical properties of discrete systems\n",
      "and for modelling physical systems [1–6]. They come in two major \"ﬂavours\": deterministic CA\n",
      "(DCA) [9–14] and probabilistic CA (PCA) [15,16].\n",
      "DCA are the discrete equivalent of continuous dynamical systems (i.e., diﬀerential equations or\n",
      "maps) but are intrinsically extended, constituted by many elements, so they are in principle the discrete\n",
      "equivalent of system modelled by partial diﬀerential equations. DCA are deﬁned by graph, a discrete\n",
      "set of states at the nodes of the graph, and a local transition function that gives the future state of a\n",
      "node as a function of the present state of the node connected to it, its so-called neighbourhood. This\n",
      "evolution rule is applied in parallel to all nodes. PCA can be thought as an extension of DCA where\n",
      "the transition function gives the probability that the target node goes in a certain state. If all these\n",
      "probabilities are either zero or one, that the PCA reduces to a DCA. In both cases, the state of the\n",
      "CA is the collection of states at the nodes of the graph and this state changes in time according to\n",
      "functions deﬁned in every node of the graph.\n",
      "In analogy with continuous dynamical systems, it is important to develop methods for controlling\n",
      "the behaviour of DCA and PCA. In particular, the main control problems for extended systems are\n",
      "reachability and drivability. The ﬁrst is related to the possibility of applying a suitable control able\n",
      "to make the system reach a given state or a set of states. For instance, assuming that the system\n",
      "under investigation represents a population of pests, the control problem could be that of bringing the\n",
      "population towards extinction at a given time or to keep the population under a certain threshold.\n",
      "1\n",
      "arXiv:1807.05067v1  [nlin.CG]  11 Jul 2018\n",
      "The drivability problem is somehow complementary to the reachability one; once that the system\n",
      "is driven to a desired state or collection of states, what kind of control may make it follow a given\n",
      "trajectory? For instance, one may want to stabilize a ﬁxed point, or make the system follow a cycle,\n",
      "and so on.\n",
      "As usual in control problems, one aims at achieving the desired goal with the optimal cost or\n",
      "smallest eﬀort, and we speak of an optimal control problem. One may be interested not in controlling\n",
      "the whole space, but rather the state of a given region, for instance how to avoid that a pollutant\n",
      "reaches a certain area.\n",
      "The techniques for controlling discrete systems are quite diﬀerent from those used in continuous\n",
      "ones, since discrete systems are in general strongly non-linear and the usual linear approximations\n",
      "cannot be directly applied. What one can do is to change the state at a node or a set of chosen nodes.\n",
      "For Boolean CA the state is either 0 or 1, so a change is either 1 or 0. The “intensity” of the control\n",
      "therefore can be only associated to the average number of changes, and cannot be made arbitrary\n",
      "small. We are interested in regional control of PCA, that is, how to achieve a certain goal in a set of\n",
      "neighbouring nodes of a graph.\n",
      "This problem is related to the so-called regional controllability introduced in Ref. [17], as a special\n",
      "case of output controllability [18–20]. The regional control problem consists in achieving an objective\n",
      "only in a subregion of the domain when some speciﬁc actions are exerted on the system, in its domain\n",
      "interior or on its boundaries. This concept has been studied by means of partial diﬀerential equations.\n",
      "Someresultsontheactionproperties(number, location, spacedistribution)basedontherankcondition\n",
      "have been obtained depending on the target region and its geometry, see for example Ref. [17] and the\n",
      "references therein.\n",
      "Regional controllability has also been studied using CA models. In Ref. [21], a numerical approach\n",
      "based on genetic algorithms has been developed for a class of additive CA in in one and two dimensions.\n",
      "In Ref. [22], an interesting theoretical study has been carried out for one dimensional additive CA\n",
      "where the eﬀect of control is given through an evolving neighbourhood and a very sophisticated state\n",
      "transition function. However, these studies did not provide a real insight in the regional controllability\n",
      "problem.\n",
      "Some results for control techniques applied to one dimensional DCA can be found in Refs. [23–27].\n",
      "For DCA, once the states in the neighbouring nodes are known, the future state at the node under\n",
      "consideration is ﬁxed and for PCA we have in general only the probability of reaching a certain state.\n",
      "One advantage of PCA vs. DCA is that their dynamics can be ﬁne-tuned. PCA are summarized in\n",
      "Sec. 3.\n",
      "The control problem of PCA is more subtle than of DCA. In general, it is impossible to exactly\n",
      "drive these systems towards a given conﬁguration, but it is possible to increase the probability that the\n",
      "system will reach a target state in a collection of nodes, or, alternatively, to lower as much as possible\n",
      "the probability of the appearance of a given conﬁguration, for instance the extinction of a species inside\n",
      "a given region.\n",
      "The evolution of a PCA can be seen as a Markov chain, where the elements of the transition matrix\n",
      "are given by the product of the local transition probabilities (Sec. 3). In particular we shall study here\n",
      "a particular PCA (BBR model) with two absorbing states in Sec. 4.\n",
      "A Markov chain is said to be ergodic if there is the possibility of going to any state in the graph\n",
      "to any other state in a ﬁnite number of steps. If this goal can be achieved for all pairs of states\n",
      "at a given time, the Markov chain is said to be regular. This consideration allows us to deﬁne the\n",

      "1 Introduction\n",
      "Let us start with generalities about cellular automata. A cellular automaton is\n",
      "deﬁned by two basic objects: the space of its cells and the ﬁnite aut omaton, a\n",
      "copy of which lies in each cell. The space of cells is assumed to be homoge neous\n",
      "enough in order to ensure that each cell has the same number of ne ighbours.\n",
      "This condition is naturally satisﬁed if the space of cells is associated to a tiling\n",
      "which is a tessellation based on a single regular tile. Then, each cell is as sociated\n",
      "to a tile which is called the support of the cell. Each cell has a state belonging\n",
      "to some ﬁnite set L, called the set of states. As L is ﬁnite, it can be seen as\n",
      "the alphabet used by the ﬁnite automaton which equips the cells. The cellular\n",
      "automaton evolves in a discrete time provided by a clock. At time t, each cell\n",
      "updates its state according to the current value of its state at tim e t and the\n",
      "values at the same time of the states of its neighbours. These curr ent states\n",
      "constitute the neighbourhood to which the ﬁnite automaton assoc iates a new\n",
      "state which will be the current state of the cell at time t+1. The way with which\n",
      "such an association is performed is called a rule of the cellular automaton. There\n",
      "are ﬁnitely many rules constituting the program of the cellular automaton.\n",
      "1\n",
      "A quiescent state is a state ξ such that the cell remains in state ξ if all its\n",
      "neighbours are also in state ξ. The corresponding rule is called the quiescent\n",
      "rule. Usually, we call that state white and it is denoted by W. A conﬁguration\n",
      "at time t is the set of cells which are in a non-quiescent state together with th e\n",
      "position of their supports in the tiling. Traditionally, the initial conﬁguration of\n",
      "a cellular automaton is ﬁnite. This means that at time 0, the time which marks\n",
      "the beginning of the computation, the set of cells which are in the non -quiescent\n",
      "state is ﬁnite. Deﬁne the distance of a cell c to a cell d by the smallest number\n",
      "of cells needed to link c to d by a sequence of cells where two consecutive ones\n",
      "are neighbours. Then, deﬁne the disc D(c, n) of center c and radius n as the\n",
      "set of cells d whose distance from c is at most n. If we ﬁx a cell c as origin\n",
      "of the space, there is a smallest number N0 such that the initial conﬁguration\n",
      "is contained in D(c, N0). This means that all cells outside D(c, N0) are in the\n",
      "quiescent state. Call such an N0 the initial border number . The reason of\n",
      "the index 0 will be clear later. Let C(c, n) be the set of cells whose distance\n",
      "from c is exactly n. The deﬁnition of N0 also entails that C(c, N0) contains at\n",
      "least one non-quiescent state. In this setting, the halting of a cellu lar automaton\n",
      "is reached by two identical consecutive conﬁgurations. According ly, there is a\n",
      "number k and a time t such that the conﬁgurations at time t and t+1 are both\n",
      "contained in D(c, k) and they are equal.\n",
      "From now on, when we say cellular automaton, we need to understan d de-\n",
      "terministic cellular automaton with a quiescent state. The term deterministic\n",
      "means that a unique new state is associated to the current state o f a cell and\n",

      "tagrid, we assume the Moore neighbourhood, i.e. we assume that the neighbours\n",
      "of the cell are the cells which share at least a vertex with it. It is know n that\n",

      "the Poincar´ e’s disc. A disc is ﬁxed, call it the unit disc. Let D be the open unit\n",

      "respectively, p and q touch ℓ are called points at inﬁnity of the hyperbolic\n",

      "At last, but not the least, the line m does not cut ℓ and it also does not touch it\n",
      "neither in D nor on its border, nor outside D. The line m is called non-secant\n",

      "Our proof is based on the following considerations. If the halting of t he com-\n",

      "in some DN for ever. Note that the computation may remain within some DN\n",

      "mations, which means those two theories are equivalent. The equivalence of CA was deﬁned\n",
      "and characterized. Finally, gauge-ﬁxing and gauge-constraining were introduced as ways for\n",
      "choosing or removing the degrees of freedom induced by gauge-invariance.\n",
      "Related works. A number of discrete counterparts to Physics symmetries have been refor-\n",

      "the associated symmetry was therefore an intrinsic property of the Quantum Walk. But the\n",

      "Distribution of fractional parts (i.e. distribution modulo 1) of sequences of\n",
      "the form ( ξ(p/q)i)i∈N for ξ >0 and integers p > q >1 is a mysterious topic\n",
      "as demonstrated e.g. in Chapter 3 of the book [2]. For example, in the case\n",
      "p/q = 3 /2, it is not known whether ξ >0 can be chosen so that fractional\n",
      "parts in the whole sequence remain less than 1 /2 [11]. One way to approach\n",
      "this topic is via symbolic dynamical systems called cellular automata (CA) (for\n",
      "a survey on CA, see [7]). Indeed, multiplication by a fraction p/q in base pq\n",
      "can be implemented by a cellular automaton [8] that we denote by Π p/q,pq, and\n",
      "then results on the distribution of fractional parts can be proven by analyzing\n",
      "the symbolic dynamics of this CA as in [9].\n",
      "Due to this connection, in this paper instead of using CA as a tool for\n",

      "use results on the distribution of fractional parts as an inspiration for new results\n",

      "As mentioned in [17], one of the original motivations for the development of cellular\n",
      "automata was to create a mathematical model of self-reproduction. Interestingly, 4 of\n",
      "the 256 ETA rules naturally reproduce any finite pattern given as initial conditions:\n",
      "rules 85, 90, 165 and 170. A proof of self-reproduction based on path counting already\n",

      "2.6 Space-Time\n",
      "Similar to the way Elementary Cellular Automata [19,20] are most often represented,\n",
      "the evolution of an ETA can be displayed in one single plot. Here, an instant is two-\n",
      "dimensional, so adding the dimension of time creates a 3D structure. In these space-\n",
      "time plots, time flows downward. The successive grids are stacked beneath each other,\n",
      "starting from the initial conditions at the top. To avoid the infinite planes created by\n",
      "an alive environment, we can display only the cells that have the opposite state to it\n",
      "at each time step. A lot of information is therefore lost. We do not see most of the\n",
      "internal structure and we cannot know the state of the environment. Nevertheless,\n",
      "this representation helps visualize some properties of ETA that are difficult to notice\n",
      "otherwise. For instance, certain rules create 3D space-time fractals.\n",

      "8\n",
      "Another way to see the time evolution of an ETA in a single plot is to look at just\n",
      "one line of the grid, i.e. to look at a sliced space-time plot from the side. There is a\n",
      "most natural way to slice: along the lines that preserve the neighborhood relations.\n",

      "Here are some possible directions for future work:\n",
      "1. ETA rules could be classified according to some common criteria,\n",
      "2. the approach taken in this paper could easily be applied to a wider class of TA,\n",
      "3. a GPU-accelerated implementation could be used to explore longer timescales,\n",

      "Abstract \n",
      "Cellular automata are computers, similar to Turing machines. The main difference is that Turing machines \n",
      "use a one-dimensional tape, whereas cellular automata use a two-dimensional grid. The best-known cellular \n",
      "automaton is the Game of Life, which is a universal computer. It belongs to a family of cellular automata \n",
      "with 262,144 members (218). Playing the Game of Life generally involves engineering; that is, assembling \n",
      "a device composed of various parts that are combined to achieve a specific intended result. Instead of \n",
      "engineering cellular automata , we propose  evolving cellular automata . Evolution applies mutation and \n",
      "selection to a population of organisms. If a mutation increases the fitness of an organism, it may have many \n",
      "descendants, displacing the less fit organisms.  Unlike engineering, evolution does not work towards an \n",
      "imagined goal. Evolution works towards increasing fitness, with no expectations about the specific form of \n",
      "the final result. Mutation, selection, and fitness yield structures that appear to be more organic and life-like \n",
      "than engineered structures. In our experiments, the patterns resulting from evolving cellular automata look \n",
      "much like the spots on leopards and the stripes on tigers.  \n",

      " \n",
      "1. Introduction \n",
      "A large and dedicated community is devoted to engineering interesting structures in the Game of Life and \n",
      "in the many other life-like cellular automata. It is our hope that some of the readers of this article will look \n",
      "beyond engineering and explore what evolution can contribute to cellular automata. \n",
      "Cellular automata began with the work of Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann in the 1940s \n",
      "(Poundstone, 2013). A cellular automaton is a regular grid of cells, typically square cells in two-dimensional \n",
      "space. Each cell can be in a finite number of different states, which are usually distinguished by colours or \n",
      "numbers. The grid is initialized by setting the starting states for each cell. The states of the cells change at \n",
      "2 \n",
      " \n",
      "integer intervals according to a given set of rules. Cells at time t simultaneously change their states at time \n",
      "t + 1. The new state for a given cell at time t + 1 is a function of the states of the cell’s neighbours in the \n",
      "grid at time t.  \n",
      "The most popular cellular automaton is the Game of Life, introduced by John Horton Conway in 1970 \n",
      "(Gardner, 1970). At first, the game was played manually, on a Go board. When computers became common, \n",
      "the Go board was replaced with a computer screen, displaying a grid of black and white squares. At the \n",
      "beginning of a game, the squares are all white. The solo human player then creates a pattern by changing \n",
      "some of the white squares to black squares. The computer then animates the screen with a sequence of \n",
      "colour changes, from black to white and from white to black, following a set of deterministic rules. The \n",
      "objective of the game is to create an interesting sequence of images. As the game runs, black shapes grow \n",
      "and shrink. Some black shapes crawl across the screen, traveling in a cyclic sequence of motions. \n",
      "The Game of Life appears to be simple, but it has been proven that the game is a universal computer \n",
      "(Berlekamp et al., 1982). That is, anything that can be computed with a standard digital computer can be \n",
      "computed in the Game of Life. Enthusiasts have spent more than 50 years exploring the possibilities of the \n",
      "Game of Life. This exploration involves much trial and error, with a slow accumulation of expertise. There \n",
      "are some software tools that support this research, but the most interesting discoveries generally come from \n",
      "trial and error. Johnston and Greene (2022) provide an excellent introduction to the discoveries that Game \n",
      "of Life enthusiasts have made in the last half-century. \n",
      "A difficulty we face with the Game of Life is that a small change to a Game of Life seed pattern can \n",
      "result in a large change in how the seed grows. In general, there is no easy way to direct the growing pattern \n",
      "to a desired outcome. This is where an evolu tionary algorithm can be helpful. Consider that an acorn is \n",
      "quite different from a fully grown oak tree, yet evolution is able to create a path for growth that begins with \n",
      "an acorn and ends with an oak tree. \n",
      "The general approach of evolutionary algorithms is to make small random changes to a structure and \n",
      "measure the impact of these changes. If a change improves the performance of the structure, the change is \n",
      "kept, although it might be dropped later. If a chan ge reduces the performance of the structure, the change \n",
      "may be rejected, although it might be restored later.  \n",
      "Evolutionary algorithms can achieve results that are similar to the constructions made by Game of Life \n",
      "enthusiasts, yet evolutionary algorithms do not reason like humans. Just as biological evolution has created \n",
      "extremely complex and capable organisms with out using planning or reasoning, evolutionary algorithms \n",
      "can create complex computational structures and patterns without planning and reasoning. \n",
      "In Section 2, we introduce Conway’s Game of Life. Section 3 explains how evolutionary algorithms \n",
      "can be used to evolve patterns in cellular automata. The aim is to reduce the human effort required to create \n",
      "interesting patterns, by allowing evolution to select organisms according to their fitness . Section 4 shows \n",
      "3 \n",
      " \n",
      "the results of our experiments with evolving cellular automata. Section 5  considers the relation between \n",
      "engineering and evolution. Section 6 discusses related work, Section 7 considers future work, and Section 8 \n",
      "summarizes the conclusions. \n",
      " \n",
      "2. Conway’s Game of Life \n",
      "The Game of Life was originally played on a Go board  with Go stones. Martin Gardner (1970) presented \n",
      "John Conway’s Game of Life as three desiderata and three rules. The desiderata are (Gardner, 1970, p. 120): \n",
      "1. There should be no initial pattern for which there is a simple proof that the population can grow \n",
      "without limit. \n",
      "2. There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow without limit. \n",
      "3. There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a considerable period of time \n",
      "before coming to end in three possible ways: fading away completely (from overcrowding or from \n",
      "becoming too sparse), settling into a stable configuration that re mains unchanged thereafter, or \n",
      "entering an oscillating phase in which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods. \n",
      "The three rules are as follows (Gardner, 1970, p. 120):  \n",
      "1. Survivals. Every counter (playing piece) with two or three neighboring counters survives for the \n",
      "next generation. \n",
      "2. Deaths. Each counter with four or more neighbors dies (is removed) from overpopulation. Every \n",
      "counter with one neighbor or none dies from isolation. \n",
      "3. Births. Each empty cell adjacent to exactly three neighbors—no more, no fewer—is a birth cell. A \n",
      "counter is placed on it at the next move. \n",
      "Our terminology is different from Gardner’s terminology. Gardner’s counter corresponds to our live \n",
      "black cell and Gardner’s empty cell corresponds to our dead white cell. This change in terminology comes \n",
      "from abandoning the Go board and switching to the computer screen. \n",
      "The Game of Life belongs to a family of cellular automata with 262,144 members (2 18). There is a \n",
      "convenient way of representing the members of this family . The rule for Game of Life is  compactly \n",
      "represented as B3/S23. B3 means a new cell is born (B) if exactly three of its eight neighbouring cells are \n",
      "alive. S23 means that an existing cell will survive (S) if either two or three of its eight neighbouring cells \n",
      "are alive. \n",
      "In this article, we will explore three different cellular automata, B3/S23 (the Game of Life), B3678/S23 \n",
      "(it has no name), and B3/S45678 (Coral). We chose B3/S23 because it is the best -known automaton. \n",
      "B3678/S23 was chosen because it is similar to Life but it tends to produce patterns that are slightly denser \n",
      "than B3/S23. The rule B3/S45678 produces very dense patterns. Of course, given that there are  262,144 \n",
      "lifelike rules, there is a large degree of arbitrariness in our choice of these three particular rules. \n",
      "4 \n",
      " \n",
      "3. Evolutionary Algorithms \n",
      "Evolutionary algorithms were inspired by Darwin’s theory of biological evolution (Spears, 1998; Simon, \n",
      "2013). An evolutionary algorithm includes operations for mutation and selection, applied to a data store, \n",
      "just as biological evolution applies mutation and selection to DNA. This combination (mutation, selection, \n",
      "and a data store) describes a minimal instance of an evolutionary algorithm. Optional extras include growth, \n",
      "sexual recombination, segregation, genetic drift, coevolution, and symbiosis. We will u se mutation, \n",
      "selection, growth, and a population of two-dimensional matrices for storing data. \n",
      " \n",
      "3.1 Software: Golly and Python \n",
      "In this article, we use the Golly Game of Life software, version 4.2 (Trevorrow and Rokicki, 2022), and the \n",
      "Python programming language, version 3.12. Golly was designed to be integrated with Python. Golly \n",
      "provides a flexible viewing environment for animating the growth of cellular automata on a computer \n",
      "screen. Python provides a programming environment that facilitates modifying and enhancing the \n",
      "capabilities of Golly. The Game of Life is included in the Golly software.  Golly supports all 262,144 \n",
      "members of the Life family. \n",
      "The evolutionary algorithm code is implemented in Python (Turney, 2024). The population of digital \n",
      "organisms is represented as a list of two -dimensional Python matrices. Only one organism appears on the \n",
      "Golly screen at a time . The organisms do not directly interact with each other . The organisms interact \n",
      "indirectly through their fitness scores. A two-dimensional Python matrix is sampled from the list of matrices \n",
      "and written on the Golly screen, where its fitness is then evaluated. The screen is then cleared for the next \n",
      "organism. \n",
      " \n",
      "3.2 Mutation, Selection, and an Evolving Population of Patterns \n",
      "Our playing field consists of a 60×60 grid of squares, displayed in Golly. The grid is a toroid (a doughnut). \n",
      "Imagine a 60×60 grid of squares, then wrap the grid into a tube by joining the top of the grid to the bottom \n",
      "of the grid. Next, join the left side of the tube to the right side of the tube. This creates a finite toroidal grid \n",
      "of 60×60 squares, with no borders. The grid looks like a square plane in the Golly screen, but it behaves \n",
      "like a toroid. For example, if a pattern moves across the right border of the square plane, it will reappear at \n",
      "the left border. If a pattern moves across the top of the grid, it will reappear at the bottom of the grid.  \n",
      "The advantage of a toroidal grid over a square grid is that there can be artifacts at the edges of a square \n",
      "grid, which tend to disrupt the patterns in the grid. An unbounded grid would also avoid artifacts, but it \n",
      "could increase computation time. \n",
      "5 \n",
      " \n",
      "The playing field (the Golly toroid) contains only one organism at a time. The population of organisms \n",
      "is stored in a list of matrices (in Python), one matrix for each organism. Each matrix in the list of matrices \n",
      "is initially filled with white (zero) and then black (one) is randomly added to the matrices. The matrices are \n",
      "60×60, but an organism is initially limited to the 30×30 center of the matrix. We call this initial 30×30 \n",
      "configuration a seed.  \n",
      "In our experiments, we begin with a population of 1,000 randomly generated seeds. To evaluate the \n",
      "fitness of a seed, it is copied from the Python list and then written into the Golly toroid. As the seed grows \n",
      "in the toroid over time, it will tend cover the 60×60 grid. We allow the seed to grow for 100 steps, at which \n",
      "point it is then an adult.  \n",
      "To evaluate the fitness of an adult, we compare the adult with a target. The target is an arbitrary 60×60 \n",
      "pattern that a human player creates. The fitness of an adult is calculated by measuring how well the adult \n",
      "matches with the target. The target could be any 60×60 pattern of black and white. The target is static. \n",
      "We randomly sample two seeds from the population of 1,000 seeds. We score each of the two seeds. \n",
      "The seed with the higher score of the two is preserved in the population and the seed with the lower score \n",
      "is removed from the population. This reduces the pop ulation to 999. We then make a copy the seed with \n",
      "the higher score and mutate the copy. The new seed is 30×30, so it has 900 squares. The probability of \n",
      "mutation is set to 0.1, so the expected number of mutations in the new seed is 90 (900×0.1). The mutated \n",
      "copy is the offspring of the winning seed. It might be more fit than the parent or it might be less fit. The \n",
      "new seed brings the population back up to 1,000.  \n",
      "To score a seed, we first allow it to grow to adult size, by running the game for 100 steps. We then \n",
      "compare the adult with the target. The score is calculated by comparing each square in the adult with each \n",
      "corresponding square in the target. We start with a score of zero. We then examine each square in the adult \n",
      "(60×60 = 3,600 squares) and compare it with each corresponding square in the target (also 3,600 squares). \n",
      "If an adult square is black and the corresponding target square is black, the score increases by one point. If \n",
      "an adult square is black and the corresponding target square is white, the score decreases by one point. This \n",
      "fitness score rewards adults that put black squares on black targets and punishes adults that put black squares \n",
      "on white targets.  \n",
      "Note that the evolutionary algorithm cannot actually see the target pattern. It only receives a numerical \n",
      "fitness score that measures the similarity of the adult pattern to the target pattern. In effect, the evolutionary \n",
      "algorithm is blind to the positions  of the squares. It only considers the total numbers of matching or \n",
      "mismatching colours. \n",

      "5. Analysis \n",
      "Perhaps the most interesting question that arises from this work is the nature of the relation between \n",
      "engineering and evolution. At first, it seems that engineering and evolving are almost opposites. \n",
      "Engineering requires prolonged, careful thought and design. Evolution seems random, thoughtless, and \n",
      "often wasteful. However, a closer look suggests that engineering often involves trying many different \n",
      "approaches and learning from many mistakes, until a solution is discovered. It can also be argued that \n",
      "evolution is sometimes very economical, for example, when it preserves pieces of DNA that are not \n",
      "currently useful, but may be useful in the future (Long, VanKuren, Chen, and Vibranovski, 2013).  \n",
      "Cellular automata are a kind of bridge between engineering and evolution. Cellular automata were \n",
      "developed in mathematics, but they quickly moved away from the Go board and into early computers. On \n",
      "the other hand, cellular automata are not like most computers. Cellular automata prefer two dimensions in \n",
      "a grid format, whereas most computers prefer a one -dimensional stream of alphabetical and numerical \n",
      "characters.  \n",
      "The Game of Life began in 1970. Many of the early patterns in the Game of Life were discovered by \n",
      "creating a random mess of white and black squares and then allowing the patterns to move, grow, shrink, \n",
      "and change (Johnston and Greene, 2022). Interesting patterns were saved and used as bu ilding blocks for \n",
      "larger structures. This process seems much like the evolution of biological life. \n",
      "Now, 54 years after the beginning of Life, working with cellular automata has become more of an \n",
      "engineering task (Johnston and Greene, 2022).  Recent constructions in Life are quite complex and they \n",
      "often involve teams working together. \n",
      "The work presented in this article is moving away from the current highly engineered cellular automata \n",
      "(Johnston and Greene, 2022), towards a more evolutionary approach, but the evolution is now automated , \n",
      "rather than manual (Simon, 2013; Spears, 1998). The black targets we use to guide evolution (see Section 4 \n",
      "above) are somewhat inelegant, but we expect that the future will bring some more refined approaches. \n",
      " \n",
      "6. Related Work \n",
      "In past work (Turney, 2020), we simulated Game of Life organisms that could gradually increase their \n",
      "fitness over many generations, by adding layers of different types of reproduction. The first layer was simple \n",
      "16 \n",
      " \n",
      "asexual reproduction. The second layer added a more complex form of asexual reproduction. The third \n",
      "layer added sexual reproduction. The fourth layer added symbiosis. The fitness of the organisms was \n",
      "defined simply as how large they grew within a fixed time limit (a fixed number of steps in the game). \n",
      "In the current article, the reproduction of Life organisms is based on simple asexual reproduction. It is \n",
      "different from the earlier work (Turney, 2020) in that the evolution of the organism is guided by various \n",
      "targets. A target is used to calculate the fitness of an organism. Organisms that match well with the target \n",
      "are more likely to reproduce (with mutations) and organisms that do not match well tend to die (they leave \n",
      "the population). This is unlike the past work (Turney, 2020), where growth was the only goal. \n",
      "Perhaps the most similar work to ours is Evolving Interesting Initial Conditions for Cellular Automata \n",
      "of the Game of Life Type (Alfonseca and Soler Gil, 2012). We are both exploring the Game of Life and we \n",
      "are both particularly interested in the initial conditions. The initial conditions determine the future results. \n",
      "In our case, the evolutionary algorithm generates an evolved seed by randomly creating many seeds, using \n",
      "mutation and selection, until it finds the seed that best approximates the target. In the case of Alfonseca and \n",
      "Soler Gil, they explore time-dependent rules and alternating rules. Both of us use a 60×60 toroid.  \n",
      "Alfonseca and Soler Gil wrote that “… each complete execution of the genetic algorithm takes over \n",
      "half an hour, because the CA used by the algorithm must be run for each set of initial conditions in the \n",
      "population through generations 1 to 54 to compute the ir fitness…” (see their page 60). This is somewhat \n",
      "similar to our approach. The main difference is that our targets are bands of black and white, whereas their \n",
      "interest is in common objects in the Game of Life, such as gliders, R-pentominoes, and exploders. \n",
      " \n",
      "7. Future Work \n",
      "In our experiments above, each seed grows for 100 steps and then becomes an adult. If we allowed the \n",
      "growth to continue past 100 steps, without any interference, the adult would gradually change. It would no \n",
      "longer conform to the shape of the target. Its fitness would gradually decrease. This could be viewed as the \n",
      "adult entering old age and eventually death.  \n",
      "It would be possible to allow the evolution of the adult to continue indefinitely, if the adult were \n",
      "constantly mutated, repairing any damage that occurs. Ongoing mutation and selection could maintain the \n",
      "adult form indefinitely. The adult would still change over time, but the target would continuously guide it \n",
      "back, so that the adult never wandered far from the target. \n",
      " \n",
      "8. Conclusions \n",
      "Johnston and Greene (2022) provide an excellent survey of research in the Game of Life. They describe \n",
      "early discoveries in Life, based on random fumbling (their term, not ours), followed by classifying \n",
      "17 \n",
      " \n",
      "structures into various basic types, then combining parts to make complex interactive wholes. Their book \n",
      "spans twelve chapters, more than four hundred pages of discoveries about Life. Since Life is known to be \n",
      "a universal computer, it seems that there should be no limit to the growth of our knowledge about Life. This \n",
      "is supported by the progress we have seen over more than 50 years of Life (Gardner, 1970). \n",
      "Johnston and Greene (2022) describe various software tools that have been constructed to support \n",
      "constructions in Life, but evolutionary algorithms are not discussed. The word evolution occurs 58 times in \n",
      "their book, but only in the generic sense of change, not in the sense of mutation and selection (Spears, 1998; \n",
      "Simon, 2013). The field of Life has evolved by a kind of manual mutation and selection of Life structures, \n",
      "but there is little work on computational mutation and selection of Life structures. One explanation for this \n",
      "is that the Game of Life community is essentially an engineering community, interested in building things \n",
      "by step-by-step design, whereas evolutionary algorithms build structures by mutation and selection, which \n",
      "is more about biology than about engineering. \n",
